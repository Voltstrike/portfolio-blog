    "title": "Predicting Billboard Ranks with Machine Learning : An Intro",
    "content": "Once every week, music fans and artists look to the Billboard Hot 100 to see which songs dominate the charts. But what if we could predict a song‚Äôs chart position before it‚Äôs officially published?\n\nThat‚Äôs the goal of this project: using machine learning to estimate a song‚Äôs Billboard rank based on historical data. The dataset contains years of Hot 100 history, including features such as previous week‚Äôs rank, peak position, and how long a track has been on the chart. By training a model on these patterns, we can predict how a song might perform.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\nüì• Input: Past Billboard chart data (rank, peak, weeks-on-board, etc.)\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Process: Machine learning model learns from these historical trends.\n\nüìä Output: A predicted Billboard rank for songs in upcoming weeks.\n\nWhat makes this exciting is not just the prediction itself, but also uncovering which factors matter most in driving chart success.\n\nThis series will take you through the journey‚Äîfrom cleaning and preparing the Billboard dataset, to training models, to interpreting results. If you‚Äôre curious about how data science meets music, this is for you",

    "content": "Before any machine learning magic can happen, the most important step is understanding and cleaning the data. A model is only as good as the data it learns from‚Äîso this stage sets the foundation for everything else.\n\nüîç The Dataset\n\nFor this project, I used a structured dataset (sourced from Kaggle)  that contains features related to individual performance. In this case Each row represents a person, and each column describes something about them‚Äîfor example:\n\nExam or test scores\n\nParticipation/attendance metrics\n\nPerformance in certain activities\n\nFinal outcome (rank/position)\n\nThis rank column is what we want to predict.\n\nüßπ Preprocessing Steps\n\nRaw data almost always needs some work before it‚Äôs ready for machine learning. Here‚Äôs what I did:\n\nCleaning Missing Values\n\nSome rows had incomplete information. I either filled them with reasonable estimates (like averages) or removed them if too much data was missing.\n\nRenaming and Standardizing Columns\n\nTo avoid confusion later, I made sure column names were consistent and easy to read.\n\nFeature Selection\n\nNot every column in the dataset helps with prediction. I selected the most relevant features that likely influence rank.\n\nEncoding and Normalization\n\nIf there were any categorical variables (like ‚Äúyes/no‚Äù fields), I converted them into numbers so the model could understand them.\n\nI also scaled numerical values so that features with large ranges didn‚Äôt overpower smaller ones.\n\nüí° Why This Matters\n\nPreprocessing might feel less exciting than model training, but it‚Äôs absolutely critical. If the data is messy or poorly prepared, even the best machine learning model will struggle. By making the dataset clean and structured, we give the model the best chance to learn meaningful patterns.",

    "title": "Predicting Ranks with Machine Learning : An Intro",
    "content": "Have you ever wondered if it’s possible to predict someone’s rank before the results are even announced? Whether in academics, sports, or even gaming, ranks are everywhere—and they often decide opportunities, rewards, and recognition.\n\nThat curiosity is exactly what inspired me to start this project. I wanted to see how far machine learning could go in estimating ranks based on past performance data.\n\nThe concept is pretty straightforward:\n\n📥 Input: A dataset with performance-related features (scores, activities, consistency, etc.).\n\n⚙️ Process: A machine learning model analyzes patterns and relationships in the data.\n\n📊 Output: A predicted rank that shows where someone might stand.\n\nWhy is this exciting? Because the project doesn’t just spit out numbers—it also highlights the key factors that matter most for performance. This makes it useful not just for prediction, but also for understanding why someone ranks where they do.\n\nThis article is the first part of a series where I’ll share the entire journey: from data preparation, to building the model, to interpreting results. If you’re curious about how machine learning can turn raw numbers into meaningful insights, stick around—there’s plenty to explore!",
